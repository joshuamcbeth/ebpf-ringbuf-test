This is a simple test/experiment that attaches a BPF program to a kprobe of SYS_openat2, then reads and outputs the command names and filenames from a sample ring buffer written by the BPF program.

build bpf:
clang -g -O2 -target bpf -D__TARGET_ARCH_x86 -c bpf/trace.bpf.c -o trace.bpf.o
run with correct permissions and memlock limit:
[go] run main.go
